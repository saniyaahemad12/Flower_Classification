# Flower_Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for flower image classification. The model is designed to recognize and classify various types of flowers from images. It uses a deep learning approach with a CNN architecture to achieve high accuracy in predicting the flower species.

#Key Features:
Utilizes Gradio for a user-friendly interface to upload flower images and view classification results.
Built using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch) for image processing and model prediction.
Supports up to 5 different flower classes (or any specific number you trained on).
Includes the trained model for inference, as well as code for training and testing the model on a custom dataset.
#How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Launch the Gradio interface to upload and classify flower images.
